## General info

This is an API built with Node.js and cheerio that scrapes sugar prices from various online sources and provides a RESTful interface for accessing the data. The API scrapes sugar prices daily and stores them in a PostgreSQL database.

The API provides endpoints for retrieving sugar prices by country, as well as the latest sugar price for a given country. The API also includes a filter option to allow users to filter sugar prices by country.

## Tecknologies Used

    Node.js
    Express.js
    PostgreSQL (save data to db)
    Cheerio (for web scraping)
    Axios (for making HTTP requests)
